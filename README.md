# Request Header Parser Microservice
This is a challenge from https://freecodecamp.org

## Objective:
Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/whoami/
and deploy it to Glitch.

Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects.

Here's the specific user story you should implement for this project:

## User Story:
I can get the IP address, language and operating system for my browser.
